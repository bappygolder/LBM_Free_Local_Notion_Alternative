# Setup Guide

This guide gets you from zero to a working Local Business Manager in under two minutes. Choose the path that fits you best.

## What You Need

Just a web browser — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. That is it.

No Node.js. No npm. No installation. No sign-up.

---

## Drop LBM into Any Project

LBM is a self-contained folder. No build step, no dependencies, no accounts.

**To use it for a new project:**

1. Copy the entire `1_LBM_Local_Business_Manager` folder into your project (or anywhere on your computer)
2. Open `data/project-data.js` in any text editor and set your `name`, `fullName`, and `maintainedBy` fields
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. Click the **ⓘ** icon in the header and choose **Reset to Seed**

That's it. Your tracker is now configured for your project, seeded with your own tasks, and ready to use.

> **Why reset?** If you copy LBM into a new project, your browser may still have task data from the previous project saved in `localStorage`. Resetting clears that and loads cleanly from your updated seed file. An undo banner appears immediately so you can reverse it within the same session if needed.

## Installation

### If You Are Not a Developer

**Step 1 — Download the project**

Go to the GitHub page for this project. Click the green **Code** button, then click **Download ZIP**.

> If someone sent you a folder or zip file directly, skip to Step 2.

**Step 2 — Unzip the folder**

Find the downloaded file in your `Downloads` folder. Double-click it to unzip. You will get a folder called `1_LBM_Local_Business_Manager`.

Move it anywhere you like — your Desktop, Documents, wherever is convenient.

**Step 3 — Open the app**

Open the folder. Find the file called `index.html`. Double-click it.

```
📁 1_LBM_Local_Business_Manager
    └── 📄 index.html  ← double-click this
```

Your browser will open and the app loads immediately. You will see sample tasks already in place so you can explore right away.

**Done.** Nothing else to install.

---

### If You Are a Developer

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd 1_LBM_Local_Business_Manager
open index.html
```

To avoid CORS issues with the Docs tab, serve locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

---

## The Docs Tab

The **Docs** tab in the navigation header opens a documentation viewer with all the built-in guides.

> **If the Docs tab shows blank or broken content**, your browser is blocking local file reads. This is a browser security rule, not a bug in the app.
>
> **Fix:** Open a Terminal window, navigate into the folder, and run:
> ```bash
> python3 -m http.server 8080
> ```
> Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The Docs tab will work correctly.
>
> You only need to do this if you use the Docs tab. The task tracker itself works fine when opened directly.

## Customise the Project Name

Open `data/project-data.js` in any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code — anything works).

Find this section near the top and update it:

```js
project: {
  name: "LBM",                        // ← short name in the header
  fullName: "Local Business Manager", // ← full name for display
  maintainedBy: "Your Name",          // ← your name
},
```

Save the file and refresh your browser. The header updates immediately.

---

## Customise Your Working Areas

Still in `data/project-data.js`, find the `areas` array and replace it with your own categories:

```js
areas: [
  "design",
  "development",
  "marketing",
  "operations"
],
```

These appear as filter options in the task list.

---

## Rename Property Labels

Property names like **Urgency**, **Value**, and **Area** can be renamed to match your workflow — no code editing required.

Click any property label in the task detail panel — it becomes editable inline. Type your new name and press Enter. The change saves automatically and updates everywhere: the Sort menu, the Settings panel, and the detail panel itself.

Your custom labels are stored in your browser and persist across sessions.

---

## Set Your Starting Tasks

The `tasks` array in `data/project-data.js` contains the default tasks loaded when someone opens the app for the first time.

Replace the sample tasks with your own backlog, or clear it for a blank start:

```js
tasks: []
```

> **What is seed data?** Seed tasks are the git-committed baseline. Tasks you create in the browser are saved to `localStorage` and stay personal to that browser. See [Persistence and State](PERSISTENCE_AND_STATE.md) for the full explanation.

---

## Backing Up Your Tasks

Your tasks are saved automatically in your browser. To export them as a file:

1. Click the **ⓘ** (info) icon in the app header
2. Choose **Export JSON** or **Export Markdown**

Keep this file somewhere safe if you want a permanent record.

---

## Starting Fresh / Reset to Seed

To wipe your browser's local changes and go back to the seed data:

1. Click the **ⓘ** (info) icon in the app header
2. Click **Reset to Seed**

This restores all tasks to the values in `data/project-data.js`.

**You will not lose your work without a chance to recover it.** An undo banner appears immediately after the reset. Click it to restore your previous state — it remains available until you navigate away or close the tab.

This makes reset safe to use confidently:
- Starting a new project with LBM? Reset after editing `project-data.js` — your custom seed loads cleanly.
- Shared the folder with a new team member? They open it fresh and get the seed data automatically.
- Want a clean slate for a new sprint? Reset, then the seed is your new baseline.

---

## Giving It to Someone Else

LBM is designed to be handed off with zero friction:

1. Make sure `data/project-data.js` has the right seed tasks and areas committed to git
2. Zip the folder and send it (or share the GitHub link)
3. They open `index.html` — done immediately

New users always start from the seed data the first time they open the app.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Docs tab is blank or broken** | Serve with `python3 -m http.server 8080` and visit `http://localhost:8080` |
| **My tasks disappeared** | Tasks live in `localStorage`. Check you're using the same browser and haven't cleared browsing data. |
| **The header shows the wrong name** | Update `data/project-data.js` and refresh |
| **I want to start over** | Click **ⓘ** in the header and choose **Reset to Seed** |
| **I opened it in the wrong browser** | Tasks are browser-specific — open `index.html` in the same browser you used before |
