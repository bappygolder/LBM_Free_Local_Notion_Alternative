# Keyboard Shortcuts

## Design Philosophy

Shortcuts in the LBM follow a single rule: **do what the user will naturally reach for first.**

- `Escape` always dismisses, closes, or clears — in every context, in that priority order.
- `Delete` and `Backspace` both delete. A user reaching for either should get the same result.
- `D` is a speed shortcut for power users — it mirrors what `Delete`/`Backspace` do.
- Arrow keys navigate. `Enter` opens/confirms. These never need explaining.
- Letter shortcuts (`N`, `?`, `/`) are single-key actions that don't conflict with text input because they are blocked while a field is focused.

If a new action is added and there is an obvious key a user would press, use that key. Don't invent conventions — observe habits.

> Shortcuts are active when no text field, textarea, or notes editor is focused.
> `Ctrl+N` and `Escape` always work regardless of focus.

## Multi-Select (List & Board)

Select multiple tasks by clicking and dragging on empty space. The rubber-band rectangle
can be started from any direction — left, right, top, or bottom of the content area.

After moving selected tasks (reorder in list view, or drag to another column in board view),
the items **stay selected** so you can continue acting on them. The selection only dissolves
when you explicitly dismiss it.

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Start selection | Click and drag on empty space |
| Toggle item in/out of selection | Click a task while items are selected |
| Delete all selected | `Delete` · `Backspace` · `D` (or click Delete in the action bar) |
| Drag selected tasks to new position | Drag any selected task — all move together |
| Move selected cards to another column | Drag any selected card to the target column |
| Dismiss selection (slow dissolve) | `Esc` · click × in the action bar · click on empty space |
