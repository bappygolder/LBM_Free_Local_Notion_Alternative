## Urgency Keywords

These words in your spoken title automatically adjust the Urgency field:

| "critical", "blocker", "blocking", "urgent", "ASAP", "emergency" | 5 — Critical |
| "important", "high priority", "soon", "immediately" | 4 — High |
| "when I get to it", "low priority", "someday", "eventually" | 2 — Low |
| "nice to have", "optional", "minor", "low" | 1 — Minimal |
| (no keyword) | 3 — Medium (default) |

---

## Area Keywords

These words automatically select the correct Area:

| Keyword | Area |
|---|---|
| "doc", "docs", "documentation", "readme", "guide", "write-up" | Docs |
| "security", "auth", "authentication", "permission", "access", "SSL", "cert" | Security |
| "design", "UI", "UX", "layout", "style", "CSS", "color", "font" | UI/UX |
| "platform", "infra", "infrastructure", "deploy", "server", "build", "CI", "CD" | Platform |

| "product", "feature", "workflow", "user story" | Product |
| (no keyword) | No change (keeps current selection) |

## Tips

- Speak the urgency word naturally — "Fix the **critical** login bug" works just as well as "**Critical**: fix login bug"
- You can always edit the inferred values before saving
- If the title picks up extra words, click the field and edit directly — the inferred urgency/area selections stay
- Say the task title only — notes and other details are better typed manually
- For longer, structured tasks, use Claude instead: "Add this to the task board: [description]" — Claude infers all fields and generates a console command. See [AI Task Creation](docs/AI_TASK_CREATION.md).
