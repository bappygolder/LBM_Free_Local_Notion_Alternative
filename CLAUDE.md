# CLAUDE.md — Local Business Manager (LBM) v1

This file is loaded automatically when this folder is open as a workspace in Claude Code. Read it before responding to any request.

## WHAT THIS IS

The **Local Business Manager (LBM)** is a self-contained, browser-based task tracker. It is designed to be a standalone project — open this folder directly in Claude Code and it works independently.

This is **v1** — a self-contained snapshot with sample tasks and full documentation included.

## ADDING TASKS VIA AI

**Read `SKILL_ADD_TASK.md`** when the user says any of:
- "Add this to the task board"
- "Add to LBM: [description]"
- "Create a task for X"
- "Log this as a task"
- "Track this in LBM"
- "Make a task: X" / "LBM task: X"
- "Put this on the board"

The skill file tells you how to infer urgency/value/area from natural language and generate a `window.LBM.addTask({...})` browser console command.

**Public API** (available in LBM browser console whenever `index.html` is open):
- `window.LBM.addTask(taskObj)` — add a task; all fields optional except `title`
- `window.LBM.getTasks()` — return a snapshot of all current tasks

For using LBM alongside a different project (log tasks without switching workspaces), read `CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`.

## ADDING KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

**Always read `SKILL_ADD_SHORTCUT.md` before adding any shortcut.** Every shortcut must be registered in 5 locations:
1. `task-app.js` — key handler logic
2. `styles.css` — any new UI styles
3. `index.html` — shortcuts panel row
4. `docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md` — user docs
5. `data/docs-content.js` — pre-rendered cache

---

## DESIGN SKILL

**Read `DESIGN_SKILL.md` before doing any of the following:**
- Writing or editing CSS in `styles.css`
- Adding or modifying a component's HTML structure
- Choosing colors, spacing values, font sizes, or border radii
- Adding new animations or transitions
- Creating a new UI pattern without an existing precedent

`DESIGN_SKILL.md` is the canonical reference for all visual decisions. It documents the type scale, spacing grid, color system, component patterns, motion rules, and accessibility requirements — drawn from Linear, shadcn/ui, Material Design 3, and Apple HIG, adapted to this project.

When in doubt: check the **Improvement Checklist** (Section 10) before finishing any UI work.

## KEY DESIGN RULES

- **Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS only** — no build step, no npm. Open `index.html` in a browser.
- **Local-first** — all task state lives in `localStorage`. The seed data in `data/project-data.js` is the git-tracked baseline.
- **Notes field** — `task.notes` is plain text (preview). `task.body` is HTML (rich text from the detail panel editor).
- **Lane system** — `processing` and `on-hold` are separate lane values but display under the same "Processing / On Hold" board column.
- **Board collapse** — collapsed columns are stored in `localStorage` under `ui.collapsedColumns`. They render as vertical strips on the right side of the board.
- **Resources** — files in `resources/` are tracked in git but excluded from any app build process.

## FUTURE: BLOCKNOTE MIGRATION

The notes editor currently uses a styled `contenteditable` div. It is designed to be replaced with **BlockNote** (React-based block editor) in a future migration when this project gets a proper build setup. The editor interface uses `getContent()`/`setContent()`/`onChange()` patterns to keep the swap clean.
